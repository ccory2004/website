<p>This tournament was great! William definitely improved a lot, and I got better at debating analytics and with lay judges. We went a total of 3-1, 11th seed in the tournament, but we did not break. </p>
<h5>Round 1 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Loss):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (John Mast)</td><td><strong>RFD: </strong>I end up voting on the cloud computing because I am not sure how the framework interacts with the arguments. There is no real connection between the neg c2 and the framework other than there is a risk. I the con however doesn&#39;t impact their arguments and I am not buying that the CIA spying will spill over into the cloud computing because it is a perception argument. I think the Cloud computing argument is impacted better. <strong>Specific to us: </strong>Yall should have gone for the turns on their case and responses are not good</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Did ok, screwed up the FF a bit, was stuttering through the attack on their case</td></tr><tr><td>William</td><td>Stuttering and a bit uncertain, needs more confidence. Responses were generally good, but you could use having some more arguments. Needs to be a bit more clear about the case, and handle yourself in cross with more confidence.</td></tr></tbody>

<h5>Round 2 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Win):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (Ellen Tuthill)</td><td><strong>RFD: </strong>Both sides did well. This wasn&#39;t a super easy decision. The main differentiator was that the Neg questioned the Pro&#39;s ability to collect less data and still keep the country safe. The likelihood of bio attacks wasn&#39;t demonstrated. The Neg&#39;s ethics crisis in having the CIA manage surveillance instead of the NSA, was a good argument. The Negs also demonstrated that the Aff&#39;s data on power outages dated to 2006 and was not described truthfully. Their hopeful argument that AI and big data would improve the process of data review was a point well-taken and likely.</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Pretty good, good debating in front of a lay judge. Tried to project confidence and also professionalism, but maybe worked maybe didn&#39;t. Struggled with countering their misconstrual of the resolution, and didn&#39;t make my arguments clear.</td></tr><tr><td>William</td><td>Great summary! I was very impressed with the good analytic arguments that you made, and made it super clear to the judge the contradiction and vagueness of their own case. Also did well specifying our case, and was pretty good overall. The only thing is you should focus on is gaining confidence, you are a great debater, show it!</td></tr></tbody>

<h5>Round 3 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Win):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (Elizabeth Perry)</td><td><strong>Oral RFD: </strong>Bought the FW, risk mitigation, since it wasn&#39;t debated at all during the round. We won our C1, terrorism, and respond to the arguments made by the AFF. Lost the hacking argument on the AFF, but did not link into FW, so cannot buy. <strong>Specific to us: </strong>Did not spend enough time on critiquing opposition, spent too much time on our case</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Overall great round, we were able to frame them out of the round very effectively. Spent a bit too much time on our case, not enough on opposition. Good distinction made about not providing 100% solvency with terrorism. I definitely did not have good responses to constitutionality, struggled with coming up with responses to the 4th amendment.</td></tr><tr><td>William</td><td>Great summary! This was you r best one yet, and you did a great job of rebuilding our case and getting a few points on theirs too. The one thing is probably need to slow down a bit and think a couple steps ahead to what you are going to say so you are stuttering less and more able to respond effectively and convincingly.</td></tr></tbody>

<h5>Round 4 (NEG, 1st Speaking, Win):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (David Slaughter)</td><td><strong>RFD:</strong> Reasons for decision: 1) Pro versus Con-Neg. case is much more compelling. As the round progresses it seems clear that by a preponderance of evidence, reasoning and simple logic that the SQ is the better option to go with. Neg. wins the possible increase of terrorism based upon eliminating surveillance methods. 2) Links-key links presented by the Aff. lack critical links to the impacts-harms they claim exist. Moreover, links offered by the Neg. are stronger. 3) Evidence-Neg. evidence outdates Aff. in many instances. 4) Weighing of issues-key issues in the round include the efficiency of the NSA. Neg. provides compelling enough justification to maintain the NSA. Aff. does not link the SQ to minority profiling. Data overload argument by Aff. is not specific.</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Struggled a bit through the opposition case, and didn&#39;t really have good responses to minorities and drug convictions specifically. Tried to NU and Turn the case, but was not super effective. Definitely hammered the FW in, so they were framed out and we could win that way.</td></tr><tr><td>William</td><td>This was your first round where we were speaking first, so it was a bit different and a challenge for you. The main thing was slightly problematic language about disregard for minorities, even though I know that is not what you meant. Overall, fairly good frontlines to our case, but the main problem was you spent way too much time on our case and not enough on them. I think it is very important when it comes down to first speaking to drop the contention you think is weaker, and go all in on the other one.</td></tr></tbody>
