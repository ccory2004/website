This practice was the first time we saw Graham after the Harvard tournament, which was a difficult tournament for us. During this practice, we talked through some of the RFDs that the judges gave to us, and also discussed the different ways that we could try to get lay judge ballots. Among the things that we discussed was the idea of including an overview during the Summary and Final Focus, that emphasizes the judge choosing us on the ballot. We also talked about ways we could reduce jargon within the speeches themselves. Finally, we also talked about our plan for TFA State, and an overview of the topic as well as case ideas.
