Very happy about how well Hayes and Jace did at FM, but now we have to focus on Hays and Harvard. Reviewed some critiques from the last tournament so we know what we can work on. Generally, the critiques we received were positive, and I need to focus on warranting all arguments that I make in rebuttal.
