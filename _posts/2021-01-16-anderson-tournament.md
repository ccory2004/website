This tournament was great! William definitely improved a lot, and I got better at debating analytics and with lay judges.

##### Round 1 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Loss):

| Person | Critiques
| --- | ---
| Cory | Did ok, screwed up the FF a bit, was stuttering through the attack on their case
| William | Stuttering and a bit uncertain, needs more confidence. Responses were generally good, but you could use having some more arguments. Needs to be a bit more clear about the case, and handle yourself in cross with more confidence.


##### Round 2 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, - ):

| Person | Critiques
| --- | ---
| Cory | Pretty good, good debating in front of a lay judge. Tried to project confidence and also professionalism, but maybe worked maybe didn't. Struggled with countering their misconstrual of the resolution, and didn't make my arguments clear.
| William | Great summary! I was very impressed with the good analytic arguments that you made, and made it super clear to the judge the contradiction and vagueness of their own case. Also did well specifying our case, and was pretty good overall. The only thing is you should focus on is gaining confidence, you are a great debater, show it!
