<p>This tournament was fun! Kai and I got to run some more niche cases, and we were able to break on one side and get 9th seed on the other side. In addition, Jace and Hayes qualled, so we got what we came for. </p>

<h5>Round 1 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Win):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (Mirian Richard)</td><td><strong>RFD: </strong>The team from Lake Travis worked very well together and took home the win today because of their overall push of the debate in favor of their argument.</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Really good job going down the Pro case. Point by point was negated and supported with evidence, great job! Had the most contemporary sources so far in debate. I don't think that the second cross was as strong as the first. I think that your questions could have been more leading into catching them in their own argument.</td></tr><tr><td>Kai</td><td>Really good rate of speech. Easy to understand and with good diction. First point- Dream scandal. Sources (2009 & 2013) are a little out of date. I think you should look up some more contemporary sources roughly within the last 4 years. Clear points of contention. Good job on questioning, I think that you could have gone even further trying to catch him in his argument. Really nail the loophole that ruins their argument. I think your strongest part of this speech was when you supported your own argument. You widened the scope of your argument and supported it with really contemporary sources. Your going down the aff case was okay, I think you could have gone even further discrediting their argument and cards.</td></tr></tbody>

<h5>Round 2 (AFF, 1st Speaking, Loss):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (Chance Kauffman)</td><td><strong>RFD: </strong>I think I end up negating based on the impacts of pandemics.

I'll preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of non-topical affs. I end up having to reject the pro's observation in this case though, for two reasons. One, I end up buying the Con's initial argument that the National Security Agency is referring to the acronym NSA, and two, I went to the Hong Kong google page and searched NSA, and the US NSA came up, two, I went to the same page, translated National Security Agency to Chinese, and the US NSA still came up.

That means I'm basically valuing two things here, the islamophobia turn and the contact tracing pandemics argument. I have to negate because I feel the con does more work on the link and has better quantified impacts, weighing things in terms of cost-benefit, using the NSA database for contact tracing wouldn't be the worst thing ever, and if there's that capability I end up buying future pandemics could be solved better with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>It was kind of hard on the definition debate to keep everything straight and prevent our opponents from muddling it down. Made some arguements that didn't pan out in the end, which is definitely a big problem.</td></tr><tr><td>Kai</td><td>I'm, admittedly, a big fan of non-topical affs. LOL, telling me to interpret the resolution as it says (FIAT) while running a non-topical aff, you two are hilarious</td></tr></tbody>

<h5>Round 3 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Win):</h5>
<figure><table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Person</th><th>Critiques</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Judge (Glenda Ferguson)</td><td><strong>Oral RFD: </strong>Oral critique. Interesting round. Pro doesn't address negative framework throughout the round.
Pro does the right thing in starting to weigh impacts, but misses too many things. Should start at the top of the ballot and address every issue.
Very polite and nice kids. Hope they all do well.</td></tr><tr><td>Cory</td><td>Overall great round, we were able to frame them out of the round very effectively. THe judge stuggled to understand our case, but I think my extensions during rebuttal helped.</td></tr><tr><td>Kai</td><td>Good round.</td></tr></tbody>
