    <p>I have a passion for cybersecurity, especially pertaining to the defensive cybersecurity techniques. I participate in many CTF competitions with my team, Gorb. In addition, I have recently been a Platnium Semifinalist of CyberPatriots, the Air Force Association's cyber defense competition.</p>
    <p>As a member of the Lake Travis Debate team, I have participated in many different tournaments in the National Speech and Debate Association as well as the Texas Forensics Association circuit. My main event is Public Forum, and I also do Foreign Extemporaneous Speaking.</p>
    <p>I have an interest in computer science and programming. I have recently began learning Java and Python as my languages. I am also the main programmer for my Robotics team, Cavalanche(if we actually get to compete...)</p>
