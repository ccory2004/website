This tournament was great! William definitely improved a lot, and I got better at debating analytics and with lay judges.

Round 1 (NEG, 2nd Speaking, Loss):

Person | Critiques
--- | --- 
**Cory** | Did ok, screwed up the FF a bit, was stuttering through the attack on their case
**William** | Stuttering and a bit uncertain, needs more confidence. Responses were generally good, but you could use having some more arguments. Weighing was good
