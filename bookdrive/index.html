          Hey! Thank you so much for donating books to the Chiangkhong Christian Education Center, located in Northern Thailand.<br><br>
          Since the beginning of this school year, our team has been remotely teaching a group of about 30 6th grade students, and we recently decided to launch a Book Drive for their students.<br><br>
          Specifically, they have asked for books that are for elementary students, about 2nd grade and below. If you have any picture books, that would be really appreciated!<br><br>
          We will end the book drive at the end of this year.<br><br>
          If you would like to donate books, you can use the map below to find the nearest location to you for dropping off the books. We will be shipping the books off around the New Year!<br><br>
          We really appreciate your support!
